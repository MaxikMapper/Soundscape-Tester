# Soundscape-Tester
A command intended for soundscape tests. Entering it on the current map kills all existing env_soundscapes and creates a new env_soundscape that plays the soundscape you entered.
## Installation
You need to copy the downloaded .cpp file to your Source SDK project along the path `src\game\server\` and then build your project **(don't forget to add the file to the solution itself in Visual Studio)**. Download the assembled dll file to the `bin` folder of your mod.
## How to use
After installation, go into the game and enter into the console
`soundscape_test <name soundscape>`
### Example
`soundscape_test d1_trainstation.city`
